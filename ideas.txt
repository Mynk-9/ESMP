* integer_xl shall be replaced very soon with rational_xl.

Ideas for rational_xl:

1) Can utilize the -vity of the used base data type short int, or, rather use unsigned short int.
2) Unify + and - operators.
3) Make future extensibility possible.
4) Unity * and / operators.
5) Add operator for power.
6) Add operator for factorial [definately with constraints of checking if the given number is fitting with conditions of being a whole number].
7) [TBC].
